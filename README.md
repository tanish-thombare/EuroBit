# European Travel Agency Weather Forecast Webpage | EurOrbit

## Project Overview

The European travel agency aims to boost travel bookings by providing website visitors with a convenient way to check the 7-day weather forecast for major European cities. This initiative is expected to enhance the user experience, prolong visitor engagement on the website, and ultimately drive online bookings. To meet these goals, a webpage [Eurobit](https.eurobit.netlify.app) has been developed to retrieve weather forecasts from an external service.

## Features

- **Weather Forecast Lookup:** Users can access 7-day weather forecasts for major European cities.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** The webpage is designed to keep visitors engaged by providing valuable weather information.
- **Increased Bookings:** By offering weather forecasts, the agency anticipates an increase in online bookings from users who find the information useful for planning their trips.

## Implementation

The main challenge of the project was to create a webpage that interacts with an external API to retrieve weather information. The implementation involves the following steps:

1. **User Interface Design:** The user interface was carefully crafted to provide a seamless and intuitive experience for visitors.
2. **API Integration:** The webpage utilizes the 7Timer API, a free and keyless service, to fetch weather forecasts. JavaScript is employed to send requests to the API and handle the response.

3. **Data Processing:** Upon receiving the weather data from the API, JavaScript processes the information to extract relevant details for the 7-day forecast.

4. **Presentation:** The processed data is then presented on the webpage using HTML, offering users a clear and informative display of the weather forecast.

## External API

The project leverages the 7Timer API, a free and straightforward service that doesn't require API keys. This API serves as a reliable source for obtaining accurate and up-to-date weather forecasts for European cities.
